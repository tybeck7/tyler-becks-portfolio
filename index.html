            <h3 id="about">ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>I am a twenty-three year old that currently manages at a grocery store. Being that I dont want to be in retail for the rest of my life, and working there for longer than I antisipated; I have branched out to coding to start a new journey an exciting demanding career. Coding has always been something that has intruiged me, but with having no experience with it I was never able to push myself to learn. I just recently started coding classes and it instantly grasped me. Just scratching the surface diving in to the HTML and CSS basics I find myself wanting to learn more and more. I hope to make this a professional career where I'm wanting to go with it is still unknown. I would like to hopefully become a full-stack developer and work my way up a company chain to build more and more knowledge in the feild.</p>
              <p>Outside of career path goals I am a layed back human being. If a person was to ask me if I was an introvert or an extrovert I would tell them that I am both. I am a homebody and I love my alone time, but at the same time I enjoy hanging out with friends and going to do things. I have lots of hobbies! I snowboard reguraly during the winter season its a once a year treat that makes me happy. During the summer I enjoy boating, and river days are always a nice way for me to relax. In fall and spring I enjoy disc golfing its a newer hobby that I have picked up, but it is by far one of my favorite activities to pass time.</p>
              <p>Overall I am just your everyday human. I have goals, dreams, people, and activities that make me happy. I dont know what my future will look like, but I do have dreams of what I want it to be thats the excting part about life the uncertanty. Thats me thank you for taking your time to read up!</p>
